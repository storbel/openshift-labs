The Dockerfile is used by the Docker CLI build command. The build command executes each instruction within the Dockerfile. The result is a built Docker Image that can be launched and run your configured app.

The build command takes in some different parameters. The format is docker build -t <build-directory>. The -t parameter allows you to specify a friendly name for the image and a tag, commonly used as a version number. This allows you to track built images and be confident about which version is being started.
