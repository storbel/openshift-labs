A user is an entity that interacts with the OpenShift Container Platform API. These can be a developer for developing applications or an administrator for managing the cluster. Users can be assigned to groups, which set the permissions applied to all the groupâ€™s members. For example, you can give API access to a group, which give all members of the group API access.

This lab describes the management of user accounts, including how new user accounts are created in OpenShift Container Platform and how they can be deleted.
